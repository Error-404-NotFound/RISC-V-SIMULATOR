    Tried to switch on julia based libraries/frameworks such as genie but due to less documentation avaialable, it could not be implemented, aliasing of registers working and release of phase-1 complete.

# 24-02-2024
    Unwanted programs removed,Dual Core working succesfully, tried to implement an GUI with different modules of python and thereby integrating julia with python programs, but libraries such as Streamlit and Dash are not compatible with PyJulia
    and other asm files added.

# 23-02-2024
    Worked on decoding, la insruction added, Bubble Sort program working and minor bugs fixed.

# 22-02-2024
    Worked upon encoding of instructions, branch, jump and thus looping working properly, negative number parsing fixed,decoding of simple instructions working, branch and jump instructions decode not working properly, so switched on just execution of opcodes rather than pipelining and minor bugs fixed.

# 21-02-2024
    Parser updated , sanitization done and .data section can handle arrays.

# 20-02-2024
    Parser working, .data and .text sections handled correctly, load and store instructions working properly and memory table added.

# 19-02-2024:
    Initial simulation of the program working along with simple instructions such add working along with File Handling.

# 18-02-2024
    Finalise the idea and started working on implemen
